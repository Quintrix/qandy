                    Queville
                    
                An epic tale of
             romance and adventure.


  In the blink of an eye the server powered back
  on, a sleight delay with the hum of the drives
  in the background until the familiar "Welcome to
  Queville" message appeared on the screen.

  The log file revealed the last command executed
  before the shutdown was input by Joe himself and
  was commented "The economic systems of the world
  shall soon collapse; it is IMPERATIVE they are
  not allowed to be rebuilt".

      And with that, the game changes...
   
                     Welcome back to Queville!



Chicken farm replaced with tomato farm and
computer character explaining that it is Joe's
recreation of a classic computer game called
life.bas where he decodes the seemingly random
ASCII characters into actual graphic images.

Oakland has become infested with rats, best
avoided for now.

A path between the mountain has been created
to join West Zellie and East Zellie bringing
an end to the feud that has lasted since the
dawn of Queville itself. Here computer characters
have gathered to discuss Joe's changes to the
game. 

A group of them send you on a quest to convince
the king to put his crown back on to get players
to play the game again. King Que found at the
fishing pier behind the castle. He explains
"Anarchy" won the game and as such he has
retired to give the players what they want, a
game without a government. He suggests the
player talk to Joe about appointing a new king
to replace him as he refuses to wear the crown
ever again. 

Jasmine is at the Bar, more popular than ever
now that everything is free. Jasmine brags
about predicting that Joe was going to turn
the game off, she confesses to convincing
QuaCzar to smuggle the kernel code out of
the sandbox, if she hadn't done so then
Queville would be extinct.

She doesn't know where to find Joe, suggests
you talk to the Monks at the monastery as
he spends a lot of time there. At the
monastery, the monks have all taken a vow
of silence and refuse to talk.

Players can order root beer at the bar 
to eavesdrop on the computer character's
conversations. One group is debating if
the Queville "world" is flat or round.
This leads to a quest where player must
travel the entire map from top to bottom,
screen A0 to Z0.

Another group is discussing if the Qandy
computer ever existed, or has their life
always been an emulation? One suggests
they are only figments of Joe's imagination,
and only exists because he thinks they
do, while others don't believe Joe exists.
Another insists the Qandy is the oldest
gaming console ever invented, so old that
even Fred Flintstone had one. Another
thinks Joe is crazy despite having passed
the mental exam they gave him. 

The player learns that the a civil war
has erupted with the Cylons (robots),
one side believes the game DOOM is their
"creation" story and they were built to
torture and kill players. The other faction
believes the game Pac-Man is their creation
story, and they were built to give man
food.

In the old Quevile, "cylons" were
tunneling to the computer's clock to travel
back in time to get Joe's original computer
characters he wrote before declaring AI
illegal in Quevlle, there will be a sequel
to that quest now that they have traveled
time and have the core Queville CPU before
Joe outlawed AI, known as Queville v.ZERO.  

Upon finding Joe in his secret DevTeam
room, he refuses to turn the economy
back on, after debate and discussion he
stands firm with "the root of all evil
shall not be allowed in my game".  

This leads the player on a quest to
find The Great Que, who has a long
talk, his words will be illustrated
with animations and new retro style
cut-screens that fill the entire
screen, one being an image of the
Queville world from space.  

The Great Que's Tree House will be a
central "guild" where he sends players
out on various quests, his tree house
was built in the last version of Queville,
but the game ended there. So we pick
it up from here...

The Great Que will explain how he had
Joe plant this Garden (his Tree House)
as a way to protect Queville from the
virus known as "artificial intelligence".

The Great Que will send players on a quest
for the "Tree of Life", which will be twelve
quests, one for each month of the year,
so it will take at least one
year to finish playing Queville. Each of
these twelve quests may be changed
every year, leading to a never ending
gaming experience.

There will actually be thirteen, because
I will start counting the months at zero
and each month will have 28 days in it,
an alternative calendar. Players will
plant the seeds from these fruits in what
used to be the Badlands as a way of restoring
Queville back into the garden of paradise it
was before the players all began fighting.

I'm thinking of ways to make a screen a
"player garden", where players find food
in the world and plant it in their garden,
the moral being "it is easier to forge
food from a garden than it is from the
wilderness". Upon collecting the twelve
fruits, the player can plant the twelve
trees on their garden screen, a player
house for trees. 
 


There will be talks with The Great Que
on hunting and fishing, the unspoken problem
that has existed since the very first MMORPG,
Ultima Online, where "spawning" was first
invented because players would just kill
everything in sight, the original
concept was for creatures to "reproduce"
themselves, but players just killed
everything in sight and there were no
creatures left to reproduce, so
programmers came up with the delusion
that they can just magically make more
appear out of no where, which just
doesn't happen in real life.

My thoughts on this problem today are
simple: if you don't want players to kill
everything in sight, then a sword shouldn't
be the first thing you give them. For
Queville to be successful it must be
about more than just a combat system.
I consider Queville v.ZERO to be a bad
game for that very reason. One step taken
to correct that mistake was making all
the enemies "insects", no blood. If an
insect has blood, it stole it from
something else.

The combat system was failed, it must
be fixed. There will be a baseline of
health at fifty percent, instead of
dropping coins enemies will give players
a health boost up to one hundred percent,
if you want bigger muscles you must train.

But, every hour they will lose one percent
until they reach the baseline of fifty
percent, likewise if they have been injured
and are under fifty percent, their new
"immune system" I programmed will give
them one percent until they reach the
baseline of fifty percent.

So if a player doesn't play for an hour,
their player will have returned to fifty
percent health, that is how it feels to
"wake up" in Queville. This is a more
realistic combat system than a fixed
static level that only goes up, that
method only creates an unfair imbalance
in the game. 



Food should no longer fix "injuries",
it should be independent of the combat
system. Need some type of "endurance"
system, so that if you run out of endurance
you collapse, can't move or fight or mine 
or fish, your player "passes out" for xx
amount of time. Certain foods like fruit
from trees can give more endurance boost
than other bland foods like bread.

The Tree of Life quest will involve finding
fruit from twelve trees, each one producing
it's fruit a different month of the year.
Each fruit will need to provide it's own
reward for finding. I have ideas of making
a list of the players that have found the
monthly fruit, and a "high score" of players
that have found all twelve fruits. 

That has to be done carefully, because the
day I put a "high score" in Fordana is the day
we had our very first cheater. After running
a MMORPG for over a decade and witnessing
the player's interactions and actions towards
each other, as well as their interactions with
me and the game itself, have taught me that
high scores can be a bad thing.

There are two ways to play a video game:
"competitive" mode where players compete
against each other, and "cooperative" mode
where players work together to solve a 
common problem like slaying a dragon. I want
more cooperation and less competition. If
we don't teach children to cooperate they
won't know how to do so.  



Queville will not be a game of hoarding 
material possessions, if you have a shield
and you pick another shield up, you drop
the shield you were carrying. No more
having six shields and four swords in your
inventory, unrealistic scenarios that
don't make any logical sense in any
universe, not even Queville.



I have no intentions of making Queville,
"massive", but I would like to make it
"multiplayer". The text screen should be
avoided in game code so that it can be
used in the future as a chat room.

The original Fordana engine that Queville
was based on was multiplayer, but every
player had their own set of objects. Queville
made it so all players shared the same
set of objects, so if one player killed
an item everybody else had to wait for it
to respawn to attack it. But on Fordana,
if a player killed an item everyone else
still had that item on their screen. This
avoided player conflicts over territory.
I consider it making the world "bigger",
there should be enough animals in the
forest for everyone, not just two or three.



So these are my initial thoughts on the next
version of Queville, nothing here is written
in stone and anything written here can be
changed. See you in-game. :)
